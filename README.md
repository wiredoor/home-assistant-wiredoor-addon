> **No port forwarding or cloud dependency required.**
> Works on `aarch64`, `amd64`, and `armv7` architectures.

## How it works

1. The add-on launches `wiredoor-cli` and connects to your Wiredoor server using configuration provided.
2. Once online, the node is able to **expose local services like Home Assistant over HTTPS**.
3. You configure the exposed domain via the Wiredoor dashboard (e.g., `https://hass.yourdomain.com`).

## üîß Requirements

Before using this add-on, make sure you have:

1. Access to a running **Wiredoor Server** ([GitHub](https://github.com/wiredoor/wiredoor), [Website](https://www.wiredoor.net))
2. A **gateway node** created for Home Assistant, with the proper **subnet** to reach `homeassistant`
3. The **subnet `172.30.0.0/16`** added to `trusted_proxies` in your Home Assistant `configuration.yaml`

4. Start the add-on. It will establish a secure WireGuard tunnel.

## üåê Exposing Home Assistant

Once the tunnel is connected, go to your Wiredoor dashboard and expose a service:

- Domain: `myhass.example.com`
- Target: `homeassistant:8123`

Then, optionally, set the `external_url` in your Home Assistant `configuration.yamls`:

```ymal
homeassistant:
  external_url: "https://myhass.example.com"
```
